# Iris-Flowers-Classification-ML-Project
Iris flowers dataset is one of the best dataset in classification literature. 
The classification of iris flowers machine learning project is often referred to as the “Hello World” of machine learning. 
The dataset has numeric attributes and beginners need to figure out on how to load and handle data. 

* This project uses UCI repository as the dataset http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris
* This project is to classify flowers into several categories based on the features given in the dataset
* I have used two ML algorithm in this project 
  1. Support Vector Machine
  2. Decision Trees
* In both the algorithms accuracy was higher in the training dataset, as expected.
* After training the model can predict the category of flower.
